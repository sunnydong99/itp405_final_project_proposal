\f0\fs24 \cf0 # ITP 405 Final Project Proposal\
Sunny Dong\
\
### Goal  \
- I plan to make a website based on a [K-pop artist database](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/kpopdb) that I\'92ve worked with in the past. The goal is to create an interactive K-pop database that allows users to explore the type of idols by their active years, whether they\'92re in a group, and agencies.\
\
### Primary audience  \
- Anyone interested in K-pop idols.\
\
### CRUD operations  \
- Read available to all users without log in\
- Create and Update available to all users with log in for all tables - all artists, groups (and group members), agencies etc.\
- Delete available to only admin, or only for certain aspects such as the playlist in the class example music-app - not sure yet\
\
### Additional features  \
- I plan to build the bookmarks/favorites system suggested in the final project instruction. }
